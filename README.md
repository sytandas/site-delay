# Simple delay website blocker: that countdown before open websites.
I think it works more than blocking whole website for certain period of time.
The delay-time between clicking and consuming content. Give it a try. 

## Installation
```sh
Clone repo.
Go to chrome://extensions/.
Enable Developer mode.
Click Load unpacked and select the folder.
```

Core function - works.

### Features todo:
1. Time spent on particular website.
2. Some simple analysis.
3. Must be simple.

Please feel free to fork and do whatever you want to do, and consider contributing.
Thanks.
